The sane way of creating new and updating existing Github Releases with assets.

# Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)


### Minimal

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2

- uses: iamkubi/github-release@2.0
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

`token` is the only **always required** parameter to be passed to this action.  Everything else can use sane defaults in some circumstances.  See [arguments] to learn more.

[arguments]: #Arguments


### Arguments

All inputs are available as a _normal_ Action input (set as keys of `with:` map):


|           name           | required   | description
|:------------------------:|:----------:|----------------
|         `token`          | **always** | Github Access token. Can be accessed using `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` in the workflow file.
|          `tag`           | sometimes  | If triggered by git tag push, tag is picked up automatically.  Otherwise `tag:` has to be set.
|       `commitish`        | no         | Commit hash this release should point to.  Unnecessary, if `tag` is a git tag.  Otherwise, current `master` is used. [more]
|          `name`          | no         | Name the release, the more creative, the better. Defaults to the name of the tag used. [more]
|          `body`          | no         | Longer description of the release, ex changelog, or info about contributors.  Defaults to the commit message of the reference commit. [more]
|         `draft`          | no         | Set to `true` to create a release, but not publish it. `false` by default. [more]
|       `prerelease`       | no         | Mark this release as a pre-release. `false` by default. [more]
|         `files`          | no         | A **space-separated** list of files to be uploaded. When left empty, no files are uploaded. [More on files below]
|          `gzip`          | no         | Set whether to `gzip` uploaded assets, or not.  Available options are: `true`, `false`, and `folders` which uploads files unchanged, but compresses directories/folders.  Defaults to `true`.  Note: it errors if set to `false`, and `files:` argument contains path to a directory.
|   `allow_override`       | no         | Allow override of release, if one with the same tag already exists.  Defaults to `false`
| `generate_release_notes` | no         | Whether to automatically generate the name and body for this release. If name is specified, the specified name will be used; otherwise, a name will be automatically generated. If body is specified, the body will be pre-pended to the automatically generated notes.  Defaults to `false`

#### Using ENV vars

In a step before this action, run ex:

```yml
steps:
    ...
    - name: Set enviroment for github-release
      run: |
        echo ::set-env name=RELEASE_TAG::"v1.0.0"
        echo ::set-env name=RELEASE_NAME::"$GITHUB_WORKFLOW"

    - uses: iamkubi/github-release@2.0
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        tag: ${{ env.RELEASE_TAG }}
        name: ${{ env.RELEASE_NAME }}
    ...
```

#### Files syntax

In its simplest form it takes a single file/folder to be compressed & uploaded:

```yaml
with:
  …
  files: release/
```

Each uploaded element can also be named by prefixing the path to it with: `<name>:`, example:

```yaml
with:
  …
  files: release-v1.0.0:release/
```

As of Aug 2019, Github Actions doesn't support YAML-list arguments to actions, so multiple files need to be passed as a space-separated string.  [YAML multiline syntax] can be used to increase readability by having each file on a separate line, example:

```yaml
with:
  …
  files: >
    release-v1.0.0-linux:release/linux/
    release-v1.0.0-mac:release/darwin/
    release-v1.0.0-windows:release/not-supported-notice
    checksums.txt      
```
[YAML multiline syntax]: https://yaml-multiline.info/ 


### Advanced example

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2

- uses: iamkubi/github-release@2.0
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    tag: ${{ env.MY_CUSTOM_TAG }}
    name: My Creative Name
    body: >
      This release actually changes the fabric of the reality, so be careful 
      while applying, as error in database migration, can irrecoverably wipe 
      some laws of physics.  
    gzip: folders
    files: >
      Dockerfile
      action.yml
     .github/
      license:LICENSE
      work-flows:.github/
```


### Versioning

As of Aug 2019, Github Actions doesn't natively understand shortened tags in `uses:` directive.

To go around that and not do what `git-tag-manual` calls _"[The insane thing]"_, a permanent git tag, following `v`-prefixed, semver format is created, **as well as** git branches following latest minor versions.  See the process [here].

Ex. `1.4` branch always points to the newest `v1.4.x` tag, etc.

In practice:

```yaml
# For exact version
steps:
  uses: iamkubi/github-release@v2.0.2
```

Or

```yaml
# For newest minor version 2.0
steps:
  uses: iamkubi/github-release@2.0
```

Note: It's likely branches will be deprecated once Github Actions fixes its limitation.
